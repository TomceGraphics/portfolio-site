# Portfolio â€” UI/UX Designer & Engineer

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.  
I use it to showcase **client projects, personal experiments, and working MVPs** Iâ€™ve built.

## ðŸ”‘ My Philosophy
Not every project needs React, Vue, or another heavy framework.  
I prefer to keep things **lightweight, fast, and maintainable** by building with:

- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** â€” modular, component-based structure without extra overhead  
- **Tailwind CSS** â€” utility-first styling for rapid UI iteration and clean design  
- **JSON** â€” simple, flexible data handling for prototypes and small apps  

This stack lets me go from **zero â†’ prototype** quickly while keeping the codebase easy to scale or hand off.  
It also makes each project **ready to connect to any backend** without framework lock-in.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Showcased
- **Workout App** â€” Loads structured JSON workouts and presents them with a modern UI.  
- **Graph Visualization Tool** â€” Built to study algorithms, with an interactive but simple design.  
- **AI Prompt Library** â€” 300+ structured prompts (JSON generated via Python), with search, filtering, favorites, copy-to-clipboard, and dark/light theme support.  

Most projects follow the same stack: **Vanilla JS + Tailwind + JSON**, sometimes with Python utilities for data generation.
